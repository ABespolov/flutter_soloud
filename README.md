## Overview

The ***flutter_soloud*** plugin utilizes a [forked](https://github.com/alnitak/soloud) repository of [SoLoud](https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud), where the [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) audio backend has been updated and is located in src/soloud.

For information regarding the SoLoud license, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/alnitak/soloud/blob/f4f089aa592aa45f5f6fa8c8efff64996fae920f/LICENSE).


There are 5 examples:
*(to use microphone on MacOs or iOS you should add audio input permission in the example app)*

**The 1st** is a simple use-case to show how to play a sound and how to activate the capture.

**The 2nd** aims to show a visualization of frequencies and wave data. 
The file [**Visualizer.dart**] uses `getAudioTexture2D` to store new audio data into `audioData` on every tick.

The video below illustrates how the data is then converted to an image (the upper widget) and sent to the shader (the middle widget). 
The bottom widgets use FFT data on the left and wave data represented with a row of yellow vertical containers with the height taken from `audioData` on the right.

The `getAudioTexture2D` returns an array of 512x256. Each row contains 256 Floats of FFT data and 256 Floats of wave data, making it possible to write a shader like a spectrogram (shader #8) or a 3D visualization (shader #9).

Shaders from 1 to 7 are using just 1 row of the `audioData`. Therefore, the texture generated to feed the shader should be 256x2 px. The 1st row represents the FFT data, and the 2nd represents the wave data.

Since many operations are required for each frame, the CPU and GPU can be under stress, leading to overheating of a mobile device. 
It seems that sending an image (with `setImageSampler()`) to the shader is very expensive. You can observe this by disabling the shader widget.

***The 3rd*** example demonstrates how to manage sounds using their handles: every sound should be loaded before it can be played. Loading a sound can take some time and should not be done during gameplay, for instance, in a game. Once a sound is loaded, it can be played, and every instance of that same audio will be identified by its *handle*.

The example shows how you can have background music and play a fire sound multiple times.

https://github.com/alnitak/flutter_soloud/assets/192827/92c9db80-80ee-4a27-b6a9-3e089ffe600e


***The 4th*** example shows how to enance audio with 3D capabilities. There is a circle where the listener is placed in the center and a moving siren audio is represented by a little circle which is automatically animated or can be moved by mouse gesture. The sound volume fades off at the circonference. There is also a doppler effect that can be turned off.

https://github.com/alnitak/flutter_soloud/assets/192827/f7cf9d71-be4f-4c83-99ff-89dbd9378859


***The 5th*** example shows how to generete [**SoundProps**] key sounds. There is a handy tool method to generate the 12 key notes of a given octave. A widget to play them can be used with the touch or a keyboard. Different types of waveforms can be chosen including square,`saw`,`sin`,`triangle`,`bounce`,`jaws`,`humps`,`fSquare` and `fSaw`.
There are also simple knobs to adjust faders and oscillators. Other knobs to add/remove audio effects.

## Usage
#### The Player
First of all, *AudioIsolate* must be initialized:
```
Future<bool> start() async{
  final value = SoLoud().startIsolate();
  if (value == PlayerErrors.noError) {
    debugPrint('isolate started');
    return true;
  } else {
    debugPrint('isolate starting error: $value');
    return false;
  }
}
```
When succesfully started a sound can be loaded:
```
Future<SoundProps?> loadSound(String completeFileName) {
  final load = await SoLoud().loadFile(completeFileName);
  if (load.error != PlayerErrors.noError) return null;
  return load.sound;
}
```

There are 3 convenient methods that can be used instead in the [SoloudLoadingTool] class:
- ```Future<SoundProps?> loadFromAssets(String path)```
- ```Future<SoundProps?> loadFromFile(String path)```
- ```Future<SoundProps?> loadFromUrl(String url)```

The [SoundProps] class:
```
class SoundProps {
  SoundProps(this.soundHash);

  // the [hash] returned by [loadFile]
  final int soundHash;

  /// handles of this sound. Multiple instances of this sound can be
  /// played, each with their unique handle
  List<int> handle = [];

  /// the user can listed ie when a sound ends or key events (TODO)
  StreamController<StreamSoundEvent> soundEvents = StreamController.broadcast();
}
```
*soundHash* and *handle* list are then used to call many methods in the *AudioIsolate()* class.

**warning**: when you call a load* method, in return you will get a SoundProps. This is the reference to the sound which is used by SoLoud and need to be disposed when is no more needed. When you play a SoundsProps, intstead a new handle, to identify the new playing instance, is created and added to SoundProps.handle list. This let you play the sound as many times you want without calling a load* method again which can be laggy.
To dispose a sound call you should call *Soloud().disposeSound* or *Soloud().disposeAllSounds*

#### Capture from microphone

Start the capture
```
SoLoud().initCapture();
SoLoud().startCapture();
```
now it's possible to get audio data. When the mic is no more needed, it can be stopped:
```
SoLoud().stopCapture();
```
With the audio data it will be simple to do something like in the 1st example:


https://github.com/alnitak/flutter_soloud/assets/192827/b7d0343a-c646-4741-abab-bd88599212d0

The `PlayerErrors` enum:
|name|description|
|---|---|
|***noError***|No error|
|***invalidParameter***|Some parameter is invalid|
|***fileNotFound***|File not found|
|***fileLoadFailed***|File found, but could not be loaded|
|***dllNotFound***|DLL not found, or wrong DLL|
|***outOfMemory***|Out of memory|

|***isolateAlreadyStarted***|Audio isolate already started|
|***isolateNotStarted***|Audio isolate not yet started|
|***engineNotInited***|Engine not yet started|

*AudioIsolate()* has a `StreamController` which can be used, for now, only to know when a sound handle reached the end:
```
StreamSubscription<StreamSoundEvent>? _subscription;
void listedToEndPlaying(SoundProps sound) {
  _subscription = sound!.soundEvents.stream.listen(
    (event) {
      /// Here the [event.handle] of [sound] has naturally finished
      /// and [sound.handle] doesn't contains [envent.handle] anymore.
      /// Not passing here when calling [SoLoud().stop()]
      /// or [SoLoud().disposeSound()]
    },
  );
}
```
it has also a `StreamController` to monitor when the engine starts or stops:
```
SoLoud().audioEvent.stream.listen(
  (event) {
    /// event is of [AudioEvent] enum type:
    /// [AudioEvent.isolateStarted] the player is started and sounds can be played
    /// [AudioEvent.isolateStopped] player stopped
    /// [captureStarted] microphone is active and audio data can be read
    /// [captureStopped] microphone stopped
  },
);
```

#### Capture methods

| **setCaptureFftSmoothing**| CaptureErrors| `double` smooth | Smooth FFT data.<br/>When new data is read and the values are decreasing, the new value will be decreased with an amplitude between the old and the new value. This will resul on a less shaky visualization.<br/><br/>[smooth] must be in the [0.0 ~ 1.0] range.<br/>0 = no smooth<br/>1 = full smooth<br/><br/>the new value is calculated with:<br/>newFreq = smooth * oldFreq + (1 - smooth) * newFreq|



## Contribute

To use native code, bindings from Dart to C/C++ are needed. To avoid writing these manually, they are generated from the header file (`src/ffi_gen_tmp.h`) using [package:ffigen](https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen) and temporarily stored in `lib/flutter_soloud_FFIGEN.dart`. You can generate the bindings by running `dart run ffigen`.

Since I needed to modify the generated `.dart` file, I followed this flow:
1. Copy the function declarations to be generated into `src/ffi_gen_tmp.h`.
2. The file `lib/flutter_soloud_FFIGEN.dart` will be generated.
3. Copy the relevant code for the new functions from `lib/flutter_soloud_FFIGEN.dart` into `lib/flutter_soloud_bindings_ffi.dart`.

Additionally, I have forked the [SoLoud](https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud) repository and made modifications to include the latest [Miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) audio backend. This backend is in the [new_miniaudio] branch of my [fork](https://github.com/alnitak/soloud) and is set as the default.




#### Project structure

This plugin uses the following structure:

* `lib`: Contains the Dart code that defines the API of the plugin relative to all platforms.

* `src`: Contains the native source code. Linux, Android and Windows have their own CmakeFile.txt file in their own subdir to build the code into a dynamic library.

* `src/soloud`: contains the SoLoud sources of my fork

#### Debugging

I have provided the necessary settings in the **.vscode** directory for debugging native C++ code on both Linux and Windows. To debug on Android, please use Android Studio and open the project located in the ***example/android*** directory. However, I am not familiar with the process of debugging native code on Mac and iOS.

#### Linux

If you encounter any glitches, they might be caused by PulseAudio. To troubleshoot this issue, you can try disabling PulseAudio within the `linux/src.cmake` file. Look for the line `add_definitions(-DMA_NO_PULSEAUDIO)` and uncomment it (now it is the default behavior).

#### Android

The default audio backend is `miniaudio`, which will automatically select the appropriate audio backend based on your Android version:
- AAudio with Android 8.0 and newer.
- OpenSL|ES for older Android versions.

#### Windows

For Windows users, SoLoud utilizes *Openmpt* through a DLL, which can be obtained from [https://lib.openmpt.org/](https://lib.openmpt.org/). If you wish to use this feature, install the DLL and enable it by modifying the first line in `windows/src.cmake`.

***Openmpt*** functions as a module-playing engine, capable of replaying a wide variety of multichannel music formats (669, amf, ams, dbm, digi, dmf, dsm, far, gdm, ice, imf, it, itp, j2b, m15, mdl, med, mid, mo3, mod, mptm, mt2, mtm, okt, plm, psm, ptm, s3m, stm, ult, umx, wow, xm). Additionally, it can load wav files and may offer better support for wav files compared to the stand-alone wav audio source.

#### iOS
On the simulator, the Impeller engine doesn't work (20 Lug 2023). To disable it, run the following command:
`flutter run --no-enable-impeller`
Unfortunately, I don't have a real device to test it.

#### Web
I put in a lot of effort to make this to work on the web! :(
I have successfully compiled the sources with Emscripten. Inside the **web** directory, there's a script to automate the compiling process using the `CmakeLists.txt` file. This will generate **libflutter_soloud_web_plugin.wasm** and **libflutter_soloud_web_plugin.bc**.

Initially, I tried using the [wasm_interop](https://pub.dev/packages/wasm_interop) plugin, but encountered errors while loading and initializing the Module.

Then, I attempted using [web_ffi](https://pub.dev/packages/web_ffi), but it seems to have been discontinued because it only supports the old `dart:ffi API 2.12.0`, which cannot be used here.


## TODOs

Many things can still be done.

The FFT data doesn't match my expectations. Some work still needs to be done on *Analyzer::calcFFT()* in `src/analyzer.cpp`.

For now, only a small portion of the possibilities offered by SoLoud have been implemented. Look [here](https://solhsa.com/soloud/index.html).
* audio filter effects
* 3D audio ‚úÖ
* TED and SID soundchip simulator (Commodore 64/plus)
* noise and waveform generation ‚úÖ
and much more I think!
